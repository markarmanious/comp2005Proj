                        communication among group members as well as meetings. A technical leader  who is there to provide technical guidance and ensure the same technical
                        standards are being used through out the project.</br></br>

                    <p class="para"> 
                        Due to tight personal schedules we resolved to have our meetings weekly on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 3.000ppm - 5.30pm(+). Meetings were
                        mandatory and each group member was expected to attend. Despite communications through email we also had a SLACK workspace for the group. Group discussions
                        and or informal communications during the week and weekends were communicated through the workspace. We also created a git repository for the project were all 
                        the files and resources were shared.
